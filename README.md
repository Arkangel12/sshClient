# sshclient

Light SSH Client for quickly verification of
your servers.

Just configure the service where you need to keep in
watch and use this tool to go in and read your files un your phone! 

It's needed a SSH where to connect to try it, i use this one
for testing proposes:
```
host: test.rebex.net
user: demo
pass: password
``` 

Thanks to @johanfree who create this amazing robot animation in 2Dimensions which i fork it and use it as a final touch. 

This is a beta version, hope you enjoy it!
